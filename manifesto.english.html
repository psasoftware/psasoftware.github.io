  <h1>🛠️ The Ethical Developer Manifesto</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><em>by Diego – with a teacher’s spirit and a free mind</em></p>

  <blockquote>
    “Programming is like life itself. Whoever lives with principles, programs with principles.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    This manifesto emerges from working with real systems, real people, and real problems. It's not a declaration of theory, nor a trend. It’s the lived philosophy of someone who has taught for decades, and who sees code not as machinery — but as a human act. Tools are valuable, but none surpass the mind that uses them freely.
  </p>

  <div class="principle">
    <h2>🌱 1. Reality comes before abstraction</h2>
    <p>
      The domain model, the client's problem, and the rules of the business are the only source of truth. Everything else — ORMs, frameworks, languages — are transient constructs. They must adapt to reality, never distort it.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="principle">
    <h2>🛠 2. Tools must feel like a glove, not a cage</h2>
    <p>
      A good tool enables without imposing. It fits. It listens. It helps. If it starts prescribing more than the problem demands, it has lost its purpose.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="principle">
    <h2>💬 3. All code is a conversation</h2>
    <p>
      We don’t write code for machines — we write for people. For those who will read it, extend it, trust it. And like every good conversation, it must start from the other’s point of view.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="principle">
    <h2>⚖️ 4. Before I act, I ask what Socrates did:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Is it true?</strong> — Does it reflect what really happens?</li>
      <li><strong>Is it good?</strong> — Does it help, without imposing?</li>
      <li><strong>Is it useful?</strong> — Does it make the path clearer or more sustainable?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="principle">
    <h2>🧪 5. The mistake isn't failing — it's outsourcing thought</h2>
    <p>
      No stack is definitive. The ethical developer chooses when to follow a tool and when to push back. Responsibility is not rebellion — it's the power to decide.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="principle">
    <h2>🧘 6. The best code goes unnoticed</h2>
    <p>
      Like a perfect plumbing job, or a sword at rest. If no one sees it, it’s because it simply works. That's mastery without ego.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="principle">
    <h2>🏛 7. The legacy of code is human</h2>
    <p>
      What we leave behind is not just lines — but ethics, ideas, criteria. It’s not about imposing our way. It’s about enabling others. Teaching, even in our absence.
    </p>
  </div>

    📝 This manifesto can evolve. It doesn't need to be memorized — just lived.  
    Building software is shaping the future through the present.  
    Doing it ethically is what makes our work truly human.
